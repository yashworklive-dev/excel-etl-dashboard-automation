=> Place your Excel file(s) inside the "input" folder.

=> Double-click "Run_ETL.bat".

=> Wait until the console shows "Process completed successfully!"

=> Open the "output" folder to view:
   - cleaned_data.xlsx
   - dashboard.xlsx

No setup required â€” the batch file installs dependencies automatically.
